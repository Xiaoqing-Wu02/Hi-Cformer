# Hi-Cformer

**Hi-Cformer** is a transformer-based model designed to analyze single-cell Hi-C (scHi-C) data, addressing the inherent challenges of sparsity and uneven contact distribution. Hi-Cformer targets the **complex, multi-scale, and local patterns** in scHi-C contact maps by modeling chromatin interactions across diverse genomic distances.

Built upon a multi-scale attention framework, Hi-Cformer simultaneously captures both broad and fine-grained chromatin interaction features. It delivers **low-dimensional representations** of single cells that are highly informative for tasks such as clustering, cell type annotation, and imputation of 3D genomic signals. Its robust design supports generalization across different datasets and resolutions, offering a versatile tool for 3D genome analysis at single-cell resolution.
